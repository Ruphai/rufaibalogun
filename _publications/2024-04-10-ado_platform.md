excerpt: 'The Alpine Drought Observatory (ADO) web platform delivers daily drought data for the Alpine region. Accessible via a user-friendly web interface, it offers interactive maps displaying drought information for NUTS3 regions and hydrological basins. Expert users can access and process raw raster data. ADO covers various drought types, including meteorological, snow, agricultural, and hydrological droughts, initially developed and validated by a multi-disciplinary team. ADO's infrastructure produces drought indices operationally. The pipeline encompasses automated data download, processing, and aggregation, hosts databases, and features online processing tool as well as a web viewing portal. Open standards underpin the technology stack, making data FAIR and software open source wherever possible. ADO's architecture serves as a model for regional drought observatories and easily integrates with other platforms. In summary, ADO delivers daily Alpine drought updates, offers open access, and adheres to open standards, making it a valuable resource for drought monitoring and research.'
