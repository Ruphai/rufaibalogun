I am a junior researcher (Earth Observation Data Science for pipeline and workflow design) at the Institute for Earth Observation, European Research Academy, Bolzano, Italy. My research focuses on building scalable computing systems and infrastructure for monitoring planetary health including topics such as Drought Monitoring and Soil Moisture Anomalies.


**Research Interests:** 
-	Climate Change AI,
-	Earth Observation AI for Humanitarian Emergencies,
-	HPC, Cloud and Distributed Computing (Cyber-Infrastructure)

In 2022, I completed the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s degree in Copernicus Master’s in Digital Earth with a specialization in Geo-Data Science at the University of Salzburg, Austria and the University of South Brittany, France. During this period, I worked on different thematic topics in Earth Observation, Geo-informatics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My MSc. Thesis focused on the “Transferability of Visual-Language Models to Remote Sensing Images”.


At the Christian Doppler’s Laboratory for Geospatial and EO-based Humanitarian Technologies, together with Linda Menk, I developed a population spatial indicator assessing an emergency setting necessary for initiating an MDA in malaria-prone regions in the African Western Rift. At Space4Good, as a Geospatial Analyst, I worked on data curation and correspondingly development of an object detector for tree-top identification and extraction using Aerial Imageries and Surface Models (DTM, DEM). At the Sixth Avis, as a research partner with 5 other early career scientists, I co-developed the EARWAC analytic dashboard for monitoring coastal multi-hazards in 15 coastal West African countries. 


Prior to this, I completed a 5-year degree in Meteorology and Climate Science at the Federal University of Technology, Akure, where I worked on the “Climate Variability and it’s implication on vegetation health in the climatic zones of Nigeria.” 
I currently serve as a young professional ambassador at the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society working on the Industry Relations Portfolio, where I help drive actions towards supporting young professionals and early career scientists to connect to the right opportunities, platforms, and ecosystems to drive their career growth within the GRSS ecosystems and beyond.
